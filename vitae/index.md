## Computer Skills

I like playing with computer tools for building web pages and statistical computation & graphics. I improve the efficiency of my work with the aid of programming (i.e. work hard to be lazy).

- Statistical Packages: [R](http://www.r-project.org/), OpenBUGS (<del>S-Plus, SPSS, Eviews, SAS, MatLab, STATA, AMOS and LISREL</del>)
- Languages: R, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, SQL (<del>Visual Basic, VBA, VBScript, ASP, Java, C</del>)
- Applications: LaTeX, [LyX](http://www.lyx.org), databases (e.g. MySQL), SVN and GIT
- Operating Systems: 97.5% GNU Linux ([Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)); 2.5% Windows

Listed above are what I'm very familiar with, and the ones being crossed out are due to my brain stack overflow and I do garbage collection in my brain once in a while. Occasionally I also use other tools like [jStat](http://www.jstat.org/) and [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/). I'm insterested in learning Python. If I have more time to kill, I will definitely learn [http://processingjs.org/](Processing.js).

## Software Packages
